Problem Statement
You are given a singly linked list of integers and an integer k. Your task is to process the linked list based on the following rules:

Starting from the head of the linked list, consider the next k elements (or fewer if fewer elements remain).
Among these k elements:
Find the minimum number.
If the minimum number is less than or equal to k, reverse the selected k elements starting from the current position. Continue processing the list from the next node after the reversed section.
If the minimum number is greater than k, sort the k elements in decreasing order and resume processing the list from the next node after this section.
Continue this process until the entire linked list is processed.
Examples and Test Cases
Test Case 1
Input:
Linked List: 5 -> 1 -> 3 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 6 -> 4
k = 3

Processing Steps:

Consider the first k = 3 elements: 5, 1, 3.

The minimum number is 1, which is less than or equal to k (3).
Reverse the first 3 elements: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 7 -> 6 -> 4.
Start processing from the next node (8).
Consider the next k = 3 elements: 8, 2, 7.

The minimum number is 2, which is less than or equal to k (3).
Reverse the 3 elements: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4.
Consider the next k = 3 elements: 6, 4.

Fewer than k = 3 elements remain, and the minimum number is 4, which is greater than k (3).
Sort the elements in decreasing order: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4.
Output:
Modified Linked List: 3 -> 1 -> 5 -> 7 -> 2 -> 8 -> 6 -> 4

Test Case 2
Input:
Linked List: 10 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 15 -> 8 -> 12
k = 4

Processing Steps:

Consider the first k = 4 elements: 10, 2, 3, 1.

The minimum number is 1, which is less than or equal to k (4).
Reverse the 4 elements: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 15 -> 8 -> 12.
Start processing from the next node (15).
Consider the next k = 4 elements: 15, 8, 12.

Fewer than k = 4 elements remain, and the minimum number is 8, which is greater than k (4).
Sort the elements in decreasing order: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 15 -> 12 -> 8.
Output:
Modified Linked List: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 10 -> 15 -> 12 -> 8

Test Case 3
Input:
Linked List: 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8
k = 2

Processing Steps:

Consider the first k = 2 elements: 7, 5.

The minimum number is 5, which is greater than k (2).
Sort the elements in decreasing order: 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8.
Consider the next k = 2 elements: 9, 4.

The minimum number is 4, which is greater than k (2).
Sort the elements in decreasing order: 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 2 -> 6 -> 8.
Consider the next k = 2 elements: 2, 6.

The minimum number is 2, which is less than or equal to k (2).
Reverse the elements: 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 8.
Remaining elements: 8.

Fewer than k = 2 elements remain, no reversal or sorting.
Output:
Modified Linked List: 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 4 -> 6 -> 2 -> 8
